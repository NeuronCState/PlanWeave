## Why PlanWeave

Most agent tools start from a chat transcript. PlanWeave starts from the work itself.

Your project is represented as a graph of task nodes and block documents. Each file has a stable place in the workflow, and each agent run receives the surrounding graph context instead of a narrow one-off prompt. That makes PlanWeave a better fit for long-running engineering work: implementation, review, feedback, follow-up fixes, and progress tracking all live in the same local project structure.

## Highlights

- **Files are nodes, documents are blocks**: the graph is not a decoration on top of chat. It is the project model.
- **Graph-friendly by default**: task flow, dependencies, review loops, and execution status are visible and editable.
- **Global context for agents**: agents can see the wider task graph, not only the current prompt fragment.
- **Per-node and per-block agent routing**: use Codex for one block, OpenCode for another, and local review scripts where deterministic checks are enough.
- **Full auto-run workflow**: PlanWeave can claim blocks, run agents, collect reports, handle review feedback, and continue the task flow.
- **Review and feedback as first-class work**: review blocks can produce structured feedback that returns to implementation blocks.
- **Desktop and CLI support**: use the visual Electron canvas or drive the same runtime from the terminal.
- **Live observability**: block runs keep logs, reports, metadata, and tmux attach commands for monitoring.
- **Statistics, search, and todo views**: inspect development efficiency and project state without leaving the workflow.
- **Local-first and file-backed**: plans, prompts, run records, and artifacts remain inspectable in your workspace.

## Quick Start

Install dependencies and build all packages:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm -r build
```

Run the desktop app:

```bash
pnpm --dir packages/desktop start
```

## Early Test Builds

PlanWeave is currently distributed as an early test build. macOS packages are not Developer ID signed or Apple-notarized yet. If you download a DMG from GitHub Releases, macOS may show an unidentified developer warning on first launch.

For early testing, open the app with **Right Click -> Open** and confirm the prompt. Formal signed and notarized builds can be added after the project is ready for broader distribution.

Build a local unsigned macOS DMG and ZIP:

```bash
CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false pnpm --dir packages/desktop dist:mac
```

Run the CLI from this workspace:

```bash
pnpm --filter @planweave/cli planweave --help
```

Initialize or open a project workspace:

```bash
pnpm --filter @planweave/cli planweave init --json
pnpm --filter @planweave/cli planweave validate --json
```

Run one automatic step:

```bash
pnpm --filter @planweave/cli planweave run --once
```

Inspect execution state:

```bash
pnpm --filter @planweave/cli planweave status
pnpm --filter @planweave/cli planweave run-status
```

## Agent Execution

PlanWeave supports executor profiles, so different blocks can run through different agents or local commands. A typical graph can mix:

- Codex execution for implementation work.
- OpenCode execution for blocks that should run in an OpenCode session.
- Local review commands for deterministic validation.
- Review-feedback loops that continue automatically when feedback is enabled.

Each block run writes durable output under the PlanWeave workspace, including prompt, stdout, stderr, report, metadata, and monitor commands when available.

## Development

Run tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Build the workspace:

```bash
pnpm -r build
```

Run the desktop smoke test after building:

```bash
pnpm --filter @planweave/desktop smoke
```
