/**
 * Domain types for A2 — Transactional Work Coordination.
 *
 * These types describe the server's authoritative state for collaborative
 * task ownership, leases, submissions, and reviews. They are the source of
 * truth for the application services that HTTP/CLI/Desktop layers call.
 *
 * Wire DTOs (over HTTP) come from CONTRACTS-v1.md; the shapes below are the
 * internal server projections, not the wire envelope. Application services
 * return these internal values; HTTP/WS layers are responsible for shaping
 * them to `EventEnvelopeV1` / collection pages.
 *
 * Concurrency model:
 *  - Every state-changing command goes through `executeIdempotent` with an
 *    `Idempotency-Key` (16..128 ASCII chars) and an `expectedVersion` for
 *    commands that mutate an existing aggregate.
 *  - Aggregate version increments exactly once per successful command.
 *  - "One active assignment per task" is enforced by a UNIQUE partial index
 *    on `assignments(task_id) WHERE status = 'active'`. A claim that loses
 *    the conditional write surfaces as `version_conflict` (if version
 *    changed) or `state_conflict` (if a parallel constraint fired).
 *  - Domain events follow `aggregateType.action` (e.g. `task.claimed`,
 *    `task.heartbeated`, `task.submitted`, `task.reviewed`,
 *    `task.lease_expired`).
