# Plan Importer

Use this skill when a user wants to turn project documents into a PlanWeave Plan Package.

## Workflow

1. Scan the target project's planning documents, README, ADRs, issue notes, and domain notes.
2. Record the scanned source list before writing the package.
3. Extract goals, requirements, constraints, key decisions, components, risks, Task Nodes, and executable Blocks.
4. Build a coverage map:
   - every task should implement at least one goal or requirement;
   - important constraints should be linked with `constrained_by`;
   - important component impact should be linked with `touches`;
   - known risks should be risk nodes linked with `conflicts_with` or other relevant context edges;
   - task `acceptance` entries must be concrete, verifiable outcomes.
5. Run `planweave init --json`.
6. Read `.workspace.packageDir` from the JSON output.
7. Write `manifest.json` into the package directory.
8. Write task prompts as `nodes/<task-id>/prompt.md`.
9. Write block prompts as `nodes/<task-id>/blocks/<block-id>.prompt.md`.
10. Add executor profiles only when the source plan needs Auto Run; otherwise rely on the built-in `manual` executor.
11. Run `planweave validate --json`.
12. Fix validation errors and importer-created weak coverage where possible.
13. Output a Plan Import Report for user review. The report is not runtime truth and must not be added to the manifest schema.

## Block Authoring

Every executable Task Node must include at least:

```text
T-001/
├─ prompt.md
└─ blocks/
   ├─ B-001.prompt.md
   └─ R-001.prompt.md
```

Manifest block shape:

```json
{
  "blocks": [
    {
      "id": "B-001",
      "type": "implementation",
      "title": "Implement current task",
      "prompt": "nodes/T-001/blocks/B-001.prompt.md",
      "depends_on": [],
      "parallel": { "safe": false, "locks": [] }
    },
    {
      "id": "R-001",
      "type": "review",
      "title": "Review current task",
      "prompt": "nodes/T-001/blocks/R-001.prompt.md",
      "depends_on": ["B-001"],
      "review": {
        "required": true,
        "maxFeedbackCycles": 1,
        "hook": null
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

If source docs explicitly include testing or verification work, add a `check` block and make the review block depend on it.

## Executor Profiles

Use the built-in manual executor unless the plan explicitly needs Auto Run:

```json
{
  "execution": {
    "defaultExecutor": "manual",
    "parallel": { "enabled": false, "maxConcurrent": 1 }
  },
  "executors": {
    "manual": { "adapter": "manual" }
  }
}
```

## Rules

- Treat `package/manifest.json`, `nodes/<task-id>/prompt.md`, and `nodes/<task-id>/blocks/*.prompt.md` as the plan content source of truth.
- Do not write `package/global-prompt.md`.
- Do not write `manifest.global_prompt`.
- Do not create `feedback` block types.
- Do not create runtime graph mirrors, `.plan/`, SQLite stores, HTTP APIs, Docker services, or MCP servers.
- Do not write implementation state into the manifest.
- Use `state.json` only for runtime task/block/feedback state.
- Do not use the Plan Import Report as a substitute for manifest edges, task acceptance, or prompt content.
