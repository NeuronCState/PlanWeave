    "PlanWeave stores project metadata, project graph, policy, cache, and desktop files under workspaceRoot; each canvas points to its own package, state, and results paths.",

    "External projects use the source directory as rootPath; managed projects can bind an optional sourceRoot while keeping plan files under workspaceRoot.",
    "Canvas ids must be CLI-safe because generated agent commands pass them to --canvas without shell quoting.",
    "Use canvas edges only when the whole downstream canvas waits for the whole upstream canvas.",
    "Use crossTaskEdges when only specific tasks have cross-canvas ordering.",
    "Use block parallel.locks for write conflicts that have no logical ordering.",
    "Edge direction matches manifest task edges: from depends_on to, so from waits for to.",
    "Desktop layout stores canvas coordinates only; canvas dependencies belong in this schema."
